# Token Economy

Token usage is driven by what the model **re-reads on every turn**, not by how many turns there are. Long threads, pasted files, and incremental follow-ups multiply cost silently because every turn re-processes the entire conversation prefix.

## Rule

Optimize for the smallest correct context per turn. The cheapest token is the one not in the prompt.

## Session hygiene

- **One task, one session.** Start a fresh session when the topic changes. Use `/clear` mid-session when the previous context is no longer load-bearing.
- **Mixing unrelated problems is the most expensive habit** — every later turn reprocesses the earlier unrelated context.
- **Dense handoffs (~400 tokens max).** Resume long-running work from a compact written artifact (plan, summary, diff) rather than replaying prior session context.
- **LITM (Lost-In-The-Middle) awareness.** Keep critical constraints, active blockers, and anchors at prompt boundaries (head/tail), where model attention is sharpest. Avoid burying core invariants mid-document.

## Prompt shape

- **Write one complete prompt** with all requirements, then iterate by editing it. A chain of "also fix this", "also change that" forces full re-reads.
- **Batch related asks** in a single turn: "fix the bug, refactor the helper, add tests" beats three separate turns.
- **Trim pasted context.** Share the relevant snippet, not the entire file. Reference file paths or line ranges the agent can read on demand.
- **Avoid correction loops.** When a thread has gone three rounds without converging, restart with a clean prompt that states the final requirements.

## Model right-sizing

- **Haiku-class** for formatting, simple edits, summaries, lookup.
- **Sonnet-class** for general coding, refactors, multi-file edits.
- **Opus-class** for complex reasoning, architecture, ambiguous bugs.

Using the heaviest model for trivial tasks burns tokens with no quality gain.

## Tool-output discipline

- **Spatial indexing over brute-force reads.** Understand codebase topology and interfaces through structural indexes (symbols, outlines, signatures, targeted search) before reading implementation bodies. Never read thousands of lines of raw code when targeted grep/read or line slices suffice.
- **Targeted reads.** Use line ranges, symbol lookup, or diff inspection rather than dumping entire files.
- **Quiet shell output.** Filter or limit stdout/stderr from test runners, build tools, or git commands to relevant error traces.
- **Engram memory.** Persist decisions, discoveries, and session state to Engram (`mem_save`, `mem_session_summary`) instead of re-injecting long conversation histories.
- For batch transforms, pipe via shell or Nushell pipelines so intermediate bulk data stays out of the context window.

## Output discipline

- Default to terse output (see <~/.llm/skills/caveman/SKILL.md>). Most tokens in a normal response are glue words ("the", "is", "you can"); strip them when they add no signal.
- Skip preamble and trailing summaries.

## When to spend tokens

- Architecture and planning sessions where breadth matters more than cost.
- Initial context gathering for an unfamiliar codebase (do this once, save the artifact, then implement in a fresh session — see <~/.llm/skills/writing-plans/SKILL.md>).
- Verification gates before shipping (see <~/.llm/skills/verification-before-completion/SKILL.md>).

## Anti-patterns

- "Polite" multi-turn refinement of a clear single-turn ask.
- Pasting whole log files when one error line is the signal.
- Running an Opus-class model for `format with ruff`.
- Letting a stuck session grow past 60–70% context instead of saving state and restarting.
